# Instructions for authors: Preparation of articles for submission to BMC supplements, via Editorial Manager Supplements submission site

## Preparation of manuscripts

### Formatting

Formatting and reporting requirements may be different for each BMC journal, and for
different articles types (Research, review, software etc.). Please use the online preparation
guidlelines for the journal you are submitting to, and for the specific article type that best fits
your manuscript. These instructions can be found [https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/)

### Manuscript structure

The required manuscript structure and subheadings can be found on the journal website.
Abstracts should be no longer than **350 words**. Abstracts should not cite references, figures
or tables, and the use of abbreviations should be minimized. The abstract should include trial
registration details, if appropriate.

### Editorial Policies

Submission of a manuscript to a BMC journal implies that all authors have read and agreed to
its content and that the manuscript conforms to BMC’s editorial policies, which can be found
in full here: [https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies](https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies)

### Declarations

All manuscripts must contain the following sections under the heading 'Declarations':

*  Ethics approval and consent to participate

   Manuscripts reporting studies involving human participants, human data or human tissue must include a statement on ethics approval
   and consent (even where the need for approval was waived), and include the name of the ethics committee that approved the study
   and the committee’s reference number if appropriate
   
*  Consent for publication

   If your manuscript contains any individual person’s data in any form (including any individual details, images or videos),
   consent for publication must be obtained from that person, or in the case of children, their parent or legal guardian. All
   presentations of case reports must have consent for publication.

*  Availability of data and materials

      All manuscripts must include an ‘Availability of data and materials’ statement. Data availability statements should include information
      on where data supporting the results reported in the article can be found including, where applicable, hyperlinks to publicly archived
      datasets analysed or generated during the study. By data we mean the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate
      and build upon the findings reported in the article. We recognise it is not always possible to share research data publicly, for instance
      when individual privacy could be compromised, and in such instances data availability should still be stated in the manuscript along
      with any conditions for access. More examples of template data availability statements, which include examples of openly available
      and restricted access datasets, are available [here](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/data-availability-statements/12330880).

*  Competing interests

    All financial and non-financial competing interests must be declared in this section. See our editorial policies for a full explanation of
    competing interests. If you are unsure whether you or any of your co-authors have a competing interest please contact the editorial
    office. Please use the authors initials to refer to each authors' competing interests in this section. If you do not have any competing
    interests, please state "The authors declare that they have no competing interests" in this section.

*  Funding (for both the study and the publication fees)

    All sources of funding for the research reported should be declared. The role of the funding body in the design of the study and
    collection, analysis, and interpretation of data and in writing the manuscript should be declared.

*  Authors' contributions

    The individual contributions of each author to the manuscript should be specified in this section, using each author’s initials. Guidance
    and criteria for authorship can be found in our editorial policies.

*  Acknowledgements

    Please acknowledge anyone who contributed towards the article who does not meet the criteria for authorship including
    anyone who provided professional writing services or materials.

*  Authors' information (optional)

    You may choose to use this section to include any relevant information about the author(s) that may aid the reader's
    interpretation of the article, and understand the standpoint of the author(s).
    
Full details of what information should be included in these declarations sections can be
found on the journal’s online submission guide.

### Manuscript Filetypes

Editable files are required for processing in production. The following file formats are
acceptable for the main manuscript document:
*  Microsoft word (DOC, DOCX)
*  Rich text format (RTF)
*  TeX/LaTeX

## Additional information for TeX/LaTeX users

Please use BMC's TeX template and BibTeX stylefile, if you use TeX format:

*  [BioMedCentral_article](media.biomedcentral.com/content/production/bmc_article-tex.zip) (ZIP format) - preferred template
*  [article](media.biomedcentral.com/content/production/bmc_article-tex.zip) (part of the standard TeX distribution)
*  [amsart](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsart) (part of the standard TeX distribution)

TeX/LaTeX users should submit your references using either a bib or bbl file. Submit both
your TeX file and your bib/bbl file as manuscript files. Please also convert your TeX file into a
PDF (please do not use a DIV file) and submit this PDF as a supplementary file with the name
'Reference PDF'. This reference PDF will be used by our production team, to check the layout
of the article as the author intended.
