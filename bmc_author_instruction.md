## Preparation of manuscripts

### Formatting

Formatting and reporting requirements may be different for each BMC journal, and for
different articles types (Research, review, software etc.). Please use the online preparation
guidlelines for the journal you are submitting to, and for the specific article type that best fits
your manuscript. These instructions can be found [https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/)

### Manuscript structure

The required manuscript structure and subheadings can be found on the journal website.
Abstracts should be no longer than **350 words**. Abstracts should not cite references, figures
or tables, and the use of abbreviations should be minimized. The abstract should include trial
registration details, if appropriate.

### Editorial Policies

Submission of a manuscript to a BMC journal implies that all authors have read and agreed to
its content and that the manuscript conforms to BMC’s editorial policies, which can be found
in full here: [https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies](https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies)

### Declarations

All manuscripts must contain the following sections under the heading 'Declarations':

*  Ethics approval and consent to participate

   Manuscripts reporting studies involving human participants, human data or human tissue must include a statement on ethics approval
   and consent (even where the need for approval was waived), and include the name of the ethics committee that approved the study
   and the committee’s reference number if appropriate
   
*  Consent for publication

   If your manuscript contains any individual person’s data in any form (including any individual details, images or videos),
   consent for publication must be obtained from that person, or in the case of children, their parent or legal guardian. All
   presentations of case reports must have consent for publication.

*  Availability of data and materials

      All manuscripts must include an ‘Availability of data and materials’ statement. Data availability statements should include information
      on where data supporting the results reported in the article can be found including, where applicable, hyperlinks to publicly archived
      datasets analysed or generated during the study. By data we mean the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate
      and build upon the findings reported in the article. We recognise it is not always possible to share research data publicly, for instance
      when individual privacy could be compromised, and in such instances data availability should still be stated in the manuscript along
      with any conditions for access. More examples of template data availability statements, which include examples of openly available
      and restricted access datasets, are available [here](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/data-availability-statements/12330880).

*  Competing interests

    All financial and non-financial competing interests must be declared in this section. See our editorial policies for a full explanation of
    competing interests. If you are unsure whether you or any of your co-authors have a competing interest please contact the editorial
    office. Please use the authors initials to refer to each authors' competing interests in this section. If you do not have any competing
    interests, please state "The authors declare that they have no competing interests" in this section.

*  Funding (for both the study and the publication fees)

    All sources of funding for the research reported should be declared. The role of the funding body in the design of the study and
    collection, analysis, and interpretation of data and in writing the manuscript should be declared.

*  Authors' contributions

    The individual contributions of each author to the manuscript should be specified in this section, using each author’s initials. Guidance
    and criteria for authorship can be found in our editorial policies.

*  Acknowledgements

    Please acknowledge anyone who contributed towards the article who does not meet the criteria for authorship including
    anyone who provided professional writing services or materials.

*  Authors' information (optional)

    You may choose to use this section to include any relevant information about the author(s) that may aid the reader's
    interpretation of the article, and understand the standpoint of the author(s).
    
Full details of what information should be included in these declarations sections can be
found on the journal’s online submission guide.

### Manuscript Filetypes

Editable files are required for processing in production. The following file formats are
acceptable for the main manuscript document:
*  Microsoft word (DOC, DOCX)
*  Rich text format (RTF)
*  TeX/LaTeX

### Additional information for TeX/LaTeX users

Please use BMC's TeX template and BibTeX stylefile, if you use TeX format:

*  [BioMedCentral_article](media.biomedcentral.com/content/production/bmc_article-tex.zip) (ZIP format) - preferred template
*  [article](media.biomedcentral.com/content/production/bmc_article-tex.zip) (part of the standard TeX distribution)
*  [amsart](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsart) (part of the standard TeX distribution)

TeX/LaTeX users should submit your references using either a bib or bbl file. Submit both
your TeX file and your bib/bbl file as **manuscript files**. Please also convert your TeX file into a
PDF (please do not use a DIV file) and submit this PDF as a **supplementary file** with the name
'Reference PDF'. This reference PDF will be used by our production team, to check the layout
of the article as the author intended.

### Preparing figures

Figures can be provided as a separate file, or embedded in the main manuscript file.
Figures should be numbered in the order they are first mentioned in the text, and uploaded
in this order. **It is the responsibility of the author(s) to obtain permission from the copyright
holder to reproduce figures (or tables) that have previously been published elsewhere.**
Permission should be indicated in the figure legend, and the original source included in the
reference list. Detailed instructions on optimally preparing figures for all journals, can be
found here: [https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/writing-resources/datapresentation](https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/writing-resources/datapresentation)

### Preparing tables

Tables should be numbered and cited in the text in sequence using Arabic numerals (i.e.
Table 1, Table 2 etc.). Tables should not be embedded as figures or spreadsheet files, but
should be formatted using ‘Table object’ function in your word processing program. Larger
datasets, or tables too wide for A4 or landscape page can be uploaded as additional files.
Please see below for more information.

### Preparing additional files

If additional material is provided, please list the following information in a separate section
of the manuscript text:
*  File name (e.g. Additional file 1)
*  File format including the correct file extension for example .pdf, .xls, .txt, .pptx
   (including name and a URL of an appropriate viewer if format is unusual)
*  Title of data
*  Description of data

Additional files should be named "Additional file 1" and so on and should be referenced
explicitly by file name within the body of the article, e.g. 'An additional movie file shows this
in more detail [see Additional file 1]'.

For further guidance on how to use Additional files or recommendations on how to present
particular types of data or information, please see [How to use additional files](https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/writing-resources/additional-files).

### References

References should be cited in the text using consecutive numbers in square brackets. Please
use Vancouver reference style. See our [editorial policies](https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#citations) for author guidance on good citation
practice

## Submission to Editorial Manager supplement site

Please do **NOT** submit your manuscript to the journal’s regular submission system. BMC have
a special submission site for supplement articles, at:
[https://www.editorialmanager.com/supp](https://www.editorialmanager.com/supp)

*  Go to [https://www.editorialmanager.com/supp](https://www.editorialmanager.com/supp)
*  Create a username and password, if you don’t have one already. If you already have
   an Editorial Manager account with another BMC journal, you will still need to create a
   separate account for the supplements site.
*  Log in as an author
*  Submit new manuscript
*  Upload manuscript files (DOC, DOCX, RTF, TeX/LaTeX) and figure files
*  Fill out additional information, including the most appropriate article type (see
   journal submission guidelines for more information on selecting and structuring
   article types). Select the **HealthNLP 2021** supplement you have been invited to submit to. If you are
   not sure, please contact your Supplement Editor.

## Reviews, revision rounds and editorial decisions

### Initial formatting comments

Shortly after submission, you will receive an email from BMC with any technical formatting
requirements, like if the submission is incomplete, or figures files are incompatible.

### Peer review comments

You will be sent an email from the Supplement Editor, when all reviewer reports have been
received for your paper. You will be asked to log in to the supplements site, read the reviews,
make any necessary revisions or clarifications, and upload revised manuscript.

### BMC editorial comments

After the Supplement Editor has made a provisional decision, your paper will be sent to BMC
for editorial and formatting checks. You will be sent an email asking to make any required
corrections, and to upload a revised manuscript.

### Final editorial approval

The paper will then be sent to the journal’s Editor-in-Chief, for a final publishing decision. The
Editor-in-Chief retains editorial control at all times and is responsible for all final acceptance
decisions. Please be aware that the Editor may request changes, corrections, transfers, rereviews
or reject articles which do not meet journal scope or standards.

## Transfer of accepted papers from supplement site to journal site

If the paper is given final approval by the Editor-in-chief, you will receive an acceptance
letter, via email, from BMC Supplements, and will be asked to transfer to the target journal.
Please use the link in the email to log into the Supplements Editorial Manager site and
approve the transfer.

You will be asked to make a new Editorial Manager account in the target journal, if you don’t
already have one, so you can complete the transfer. You will then receive an acceptance
letter from the target journal.

When you resubmit into the target journal, it is important that you select the article type
"**BMC Supplements Reviewed**" again. This is so your paper can be identified as being part of
the supplement, and also so you don’t have to pay the regular journal APC. The paper will be
published as the article type you selected in your original submission.

## Production

The approved manuscript will enter production. PDF proofs sent to the corresponding author
approximately 3 weeks after final acceptance.

You will receive a PDF proof from our production department and will be asked to respond to
any queries and return any corrections within 5 days. Please note that major editorial
changes, including change of authorship, or changes to data, cannot be made at this stage.

The publication process takes approximately 6 weeks. However, the supplement issue will
not publish until all papers are ready.

## Open access license agreement

By submitting an article to a supplement to a BMC journal, authors confirm that all authors
of the manuscript have read and agreed to its content and are accountable for all aspects of
the accuracy and integrity of the manuscript. Authors also confirm that the manuscript is
original, has not already been published in a journal and is not currently under consideration
by another journal. If your article is accepted for publication, you will be asked to confirm
your acceptance of these points and agreement to these and all other terms of the [BMC
License Agreement](https://www.biomedcentral.com/about/policies/license-agreement), the [Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), and our [Open Data
policy](https://www.biomedcentral.com/about/policies/open-data), which we strongly recommend you read.

## Payment

Open access article processing charges for supplements are pre-agreed with the supplement
organisers ($1,625 = $1,595 + invoice processing charge of $30). Publication charges may be payable either by the author’s institution, or
collectively by a funder, depending on what has been agreed. If authors are responsible for
their own article charges, supplement editors should discuss with authors before submission.
The source of funding for both the work, and the open access publishing fees (if from a
different source) should be clearly stated in the Declarations section of the manuscript.

As supplement processing charges are variable, based on the number of submissions,
invoices are raised outside the online APC payment system - this is why the system will
charge may still apply. Please contact your supplement organiser, or the Supplements Office
if you have any questions regarding fees or payment.

Please note that due to the lower publication charges of supplement articles compared to
regular APCs, we cannot process supplement payments via membership schemes, and
cannot apply actual waivers to supplements.
